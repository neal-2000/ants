# Ants Vs. SomeBees
## Tower defense game
This GUI game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies. The goal of the game is to strategically place colony ants to protect the ant queen from waves of bees that invade your territory. 
A game of Ants Vs. SomeBees consists of a series of turns. In each turn, new bees may enter the ant colony. Then, new ants are placed to defend their colony. Finally, all insects (ants, then bees) take individual actions. Bees either try to move toward the end of the tunnel or sting ants in their way. Ants perform a different action depending on their type, such as collecting more food, or throwing leaves at the bees. The game ends either when a bee reaches the ant queen (you lose), or the entire bee fleet has been vanquished (you win). 
Ants are the usable troops in the game that the player places into the colony. Each type of ant takes a different action and requires a different amount of food to place. The two most basic ant types are the HarvesterAnt, which adds one food to the colony during each turn, and the ThrowerAnt, which throws a leaf at a bee each turn. There are other types of ants that have different roles in defending against the bees. Additionally, there are certain areas that contain water which you cannot place ants on unless they have special abilities like the ScubaAnt.
